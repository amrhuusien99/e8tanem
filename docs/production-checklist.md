# Production Deployment Checklist

This document outlines the necessary steps to ensure your Laravel application is properly optimized and configured for production.

## Environment Configuration

1. Update your `.env` file with the following settings:
   ```
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   LOG_LEVEL=warning
   ```

## Database Configuration

1. Make sure to use a strong database password in production.
2. Run database migrations:
   ```
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```

## Cache Configuration

1. Configure the application for production:
   ```
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   ```

2. Clear compiled files and start with a clean state:
   ```
   php artisan optimize
   ```

## File Permissions

1. Set proper file permissions:
   ```
   chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/app
   chmod -R 777 /path/to/your/app/storage
   chmod -R 777 /path/to/your/app/bootstrap/cache
   ```

## Admin User Setup

1. Promote an existing user to admin:
   ```
   php artisan app:promote-user-to-admin admin@example.com
   ```

2. Make sure to promote trusted users only, as regular users (role='user') can't access the Filament panel in production.

3. Test admin access by logging in to the Filament panel at `/admin` with an admin account:
   - Admin users (role='admin') should have full access
   - Regular users (role='user') should receive a 403 Forbidden error

## Security Measures

1. Set up proper HTTPS through your web server
2. All requests should be redirected from HTTP to HTTPS
3. Implement proper CORS rules
4. Ensure secure headers are implemented
5. Check that admin-only routes are properly protected
6. Verify that the AdminMiddleware is correctly applied in production only

## Performance Optimizations

1. Enable OPcache for PHP
2. Consider implementing a CDN for static assets
3. Set up proper caching headers for static assets
4. Consider using a load balancer if necessary

## Monitoring

1. Set up proper logging and monitoring
2. Consider using Laravel Telescope or other monitoring tools
3. Configure error reporting to notify developers of critical issues

## Regular Maintenance

1. Set up regular database backups
2. Plan for regular updates of dependencies
3. Monitor disk space usage
